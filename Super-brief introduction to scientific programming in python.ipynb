Avoid nested python loops if you want to get performance, but rather try to rely on e.g. ``numpy`` to do the loops internally efficiently. ``numpy`` for example has a huge set of functionality that lets one to \"numpify\" very many python constructs. This is beyond the scope if this short introduction, but you can at least get a general idea."
