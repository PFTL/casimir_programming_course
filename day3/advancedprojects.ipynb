    "\n",
    "- Don't work alone, find yourself a group of people with who you are going to collaborate.\n",
    "- Plan ahead: don't just start hacking; rather discuss how the project is going to work out, which parts it consists of, and what difficulties you would expect.\n",
    "- Use git to coordinate your work. For a small project it may seem like an overkill, but consider it a training experience.\n",
    "- think of how to organize your code so that it is reusable.\n",
    "- Add tests checking your code (more on this will come later).\n",
    "- Separate different parts of the project among different participants.\n",
    "- Read what your collaborators write, try to understand what is happening in that code, and give feedback."
