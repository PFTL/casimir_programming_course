    "In particular, you will work with 2D data, i.e. data that depends on two parameters. Such data is often stored using three arrays: Two 1D arrays ``X`` and ``Y``, and one 2D array ``C`` such that for the parameters ``X[i]`` and ``Y[j]`` the data is stored in ``C[j, i]`` (Note the order of ``i`` and ``j`` here - in this convention the x-coordinate in the matrix is along the rows, i.e.  varying the column index).\n",
