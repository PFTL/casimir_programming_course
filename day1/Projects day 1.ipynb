    "\n",
    "### Body mass of dinosaurs\n",
    "\n",
    "The length of an organism is typically strongly correlated with it's body mass. This is useful because it allows us to estimate the mass of an organism even if we only know its length. This relationship generally takes the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Mass} = a * \\text{Length}^b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the parameters $a$ and $b$ vary among groups, mass is given in kg, and length in m. This allometric approach is regularly used to estimate the mass of dinosaurs since we cannot weigh something that is only preserved as bones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different values of $a$ and $b$ are for example ([Seebacher 2001](http://www.jstor.org/stable/4524171\n",
    "))\n",
    "\n",
    "[Therapoda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theropoda) (e.g. T-rex): $a=0.73$, $b=3.63$\n",

    "\n",
    "get_mass_from_length() that estimates the mass of an organism in kg based on it's length in meters by taking length, a, and b as parameters. To be clear we want to pass the function all 3 values that it needs to estimate a mass as parameters. This makes it much easier to reuse for all species.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this function to compute the mass of [T-rex Trix](https://t-rex.naturalis.nl/Trix/default.aspx) on display in Naturalis, Leiden, which is 13 meters long. \n",
    "Compare to the [Camarasaurus](http://www.naturalis.nl/en/museum/top-pieces/camarasaurus-skeleton/) they have there, too.\n",

    "### DNA vs RNA\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function, `dna_or_rna(sequence`), that determines if a sequence of base pairs is DNA, RNA, or if it is not possible to tell given the sequence provided. Since all the function will know about the material is the sequence the only way to tell the difference between DNA and RNA is that RNA has the base Uracil (u) instead of the base Thymine (t). Have the function return one of three outputs: 'DNA', 'RNA', or 'UNKNOWN'. Use the function and a for loop to print the type of the sequences in the following list.\n"
