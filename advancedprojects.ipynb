    "#### Basic tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discuss beforehand the structure of the code that you want to write.\n",
    "- Use git to keep track of your collaborative project, and upload it to github to share with your partner.\n",
    "- structure your code into modules (i.e. have functions etc. in files separate from your notebooks that use it).\n",
    "- Add tests checking your code.\n",
    "- Work independently on different parts of the code (i.e. on different functions, or test/function).\n",
    "- Introduce an error in your code that does is not captured by the test, and let your partner debug the code to find the error. Improve the test to also cover this error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make your code a package that you can install globally on your system."
